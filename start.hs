{-The else part is mandatory, every expression and

Concatenate lists with ++. In a [1,2,3] ++ [4] situation,
Haskell has to walk through the whole list on the left 
side of ++. putting something at the beginning of a list 
using the : operator (also called the cons operator) 
is instantaneous. 
Notice how : takes a number and a list of numbers or 
a character and a list of characters, whereas 
++ takes two lists. Even if you're adding an 
element to the end of a list with ++, you have 
to surround it with square brackets so it becomes 
a list.

[1,2,3] is actually just syntactic sugar for 1:2:3:[]. 
[] is an empty list. If we prepend 3 to it, it 
becomes [3].

Lists can contain lists (of same type).

Lists can be compared in lexicographical order using 
<, <=, > and >= between lists.

Useful functions on lists, usually used in the form:
<function> <list to operate on>

head = the first element
tail = everything except the head
last = last element
init = everything except the last element.

The head of an empty list is a runtime error.

length
null = checks if a list is empty
reverse
take = takes the first number of elements from the list
drop = drops a number of elems from beginning of list
maximum
minimum
sum
product
elem =  takes a thing and a list of things and tells us
if that thing is an element of the list.
